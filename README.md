## Introduction
This is a power bi project on northwind traders. The project is carried out to review, analyze and derive insight to answer crucial questions and help the northwind traders make data driven decision.

## Problem statement
Northwind Traders, a company known for distributing gourmet food products, wants to make its operations better and decisions smarter in the 2nd half of 2015. To achieve this, the company plans to study its sales data, how customers behave, and how well its products are doing with emphasis on the 1st half of 2015. By doing this, Northwind Traders hopes to find important insights and ways to grow even more.
In their analysis, Northwind Traders wants to look closely at sales trends, how customers buy things, and which products are selling well based on what was achieved in the 1st half of 2015. 
They believe that by understanding these things better, they can make smarter choices about what to sell and how to sell it. This means they can make sure they have the right products in stock and keep their customers happy.
Northwind Traders knows that using data to make decisions is important. They want to use this information to find ways to make their business better and keep up with what their customers want.

## Skills demonstrated
In carrying out the analysis certain skiils were demonstrated in analyzing and deriving insights. This skills includes checking for data quality, data cleaning and transformation using power query in dealing with missing values and duplicate values, data modelling which was used in creating relationships between the datasets, and performing dax functions (creating calculated fields and columns) to derive more insights during the coure of analysis.

## Data sourcing
I had to task myself to review, analyze and create visuals for a dataset obtained on google drive which was provide by data-nex instructor. the dataset is about of northwind traders. The reason for the analysis is to understand sales trends, how customers buy things, and which products are selling well based on what was achieved in the 1st half of 2015. the following were the datasets used for the analysis: categories.csv, customers.csv, employees.csv, order_details.csv, order.csv, product.csv, and shippers.csv.


## Data transformation and data cleaning
In ensuring quality and reliability of the dataset. Columns were checked for duplicates, checked for inconsistencies, errors, and inaccuracies, blank cells and outliers within the dataset. The following were keys steps used in ensuring the dataset was ready for analysis.
1. Data quality
2. Data integrity
3. Check for duplicate values
4. Check for missing values
5. Conditional formatting
6. Data modelling
7. Application of dax functions (calculated fields and new columns)

## Data cleaning process
After reviewing the datasets, it was discovered that the employees dataset has blank cells (null value), other datasets has duplicate values which was necessary i checked for data quality of all the datasets provided. the data cleaning process was done using power query.

## Data modelling

In the course of the analysis in other to derive insights in answering the business questions.the datasets were modelled thereby creating relationships in order to derive more insights.
the image below shows the relationships of the necessary datasets that were required in answering the business questions.

## Analyzing and visualization
In answering the business questions, i carried out descriptive analysis in order to understand the datasets after data modelling was done. The following were insights derived for the first quarter in 2015: 
1. Revenue (sales) for 2015 was $441,000
2. The average revenue(sales) was $63800
3. Total quantity was 16000
4. Total order 270000
5. Total customer 81

## Actual Analysis
After carrying out descriptive analysis, i divided the analysis into two major segments/parts, the first one majorly focuses on the sales (revenue) generated during the first quarter in 2015 some of the key performance indicators i used were as follows: Top 10 order by country, quantity order by month, revenue generated by month, Top 10 revenue by products, and lastly order by category. The last analysis focuses majorly on product performances using total sales, order amd total quantity as key metrixs in deriving insights.
